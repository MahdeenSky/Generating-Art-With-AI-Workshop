I will be teaching us how to use an open source AI Image Generation Model that is called Stable Diffusion V1.5, which allows us to generate cool images, photoshop/change existing images, get variation of images, and turn sketches into real prototypes.

Google Collab will be provided such that everyone can use to follow the steps. 
By the end of the workshop, the audience will learn how to graphic design, and make assets, without photoshop knowledge.

## Setup
Test it for yourself using this google collab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MahdeenSky/Generating-Art-With-AI-Workshop/blob/main/StableDiffusionWebUI.ipynb)

Make sure you've changed the runtime type in the collab, and select the hardware accelerator of "GPU" otherwise it will not work.
Run each cell in the notebook, until you get a public URL from the last cell.
